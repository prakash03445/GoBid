# GoBid

GoBid is a real-time auction system built in Go using gRPC. It allows multiple buyers to bid on products in real-time and provides an interactive server to manage auctions.

## Usage

To run the server:

```bash
go run main.go
```

## Client

The interactive CLI client for GoBid is available in the **[GoBidClient](https://github.com/prakash03445/GoBidClient)**. Use the client to connect to the server, add products, and place bids.

## Testing with gRPC Tools

If you prefer testing with tools like Postman or grpcurl, you can get the proto file from: **[GoBidProto](https://github.com/prakash03445/GoBidProto)**.
