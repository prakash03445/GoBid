# GoBid

GoBid is a real-time auction system built in Go using gRPC. It allows multiple buyers to bid on products in real-time and provides an interactive server to manage auctions.

> **Note:** This project is still under development and some features haven't been fully implemented yet.

## Client

The interactive CLI client for GoBid is available in the [GoBidClient](https://github.com/prakash03445/GoBidClient) repository. Use the client to connect to the server, add products, and place bids.

## Usage

To run the server:

```bash
go run main.go
